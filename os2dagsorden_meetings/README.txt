The purpose of this module is to import the meetings from the XML files, which are located in the directory configured in OS2Web general settings.

This module has a tight connection with Adlib Api module: it will schedule the files for convertion (any format -> PDF, if needed, and any format -> HTML) and reattach the file to the bullet point, once the convertion is finished.
